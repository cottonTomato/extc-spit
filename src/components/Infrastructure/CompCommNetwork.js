                The Computer Communication Laboratory is a dedicated space
                equipped with specialized hardware and software used for
                studying and experimenting with various aspects of computer
                networking and communication systems. In this laboratory,
                students and researchers have access to networking devices, such
                as routers, switches, and servers, as well as simulation tools
                and software-defined networking platforms. They can engage in
                hands-on experiments to gain practical experience in
                configuring, analyzing, and troubleshooting network protocols
                and technologies. Additionally, the laboratory may offer
                opportunities for conducting research projects related to
                network security, performance optimization, and emerging
                communication technologies, contributing to advancements in the
                field of computer communication.
